        <h5>Perfect for summer picnics, this is a no-bake version 
            of cheesecake in a portable jar with fresh 
            strawberries.</h5>

        <p>Cheesecake is a sweet dessert consisting of one or more 
            layers. The main, and thickest, layer consists of a 
            mixture of a soft, fresh cheese (typically cottage 
            cheese, cream cheese or ricotta), eggs, and sugar. If 
            there is a bottom layer, it most often consists of a 
            crust or base made from crushed cookies (or digestive 
            biscuits), graham crackers, pastry, or sometimes sponge 
            cake.[1] Cheesecake may be baked or unbaked (and is 
            usually refrigerated).</p>

        <p>Cheesecake is usually sweetened with sugar and may be 
            flavored in different ways. Vanilla, spices, lemon, 
            chocolate, pumpkin, or other flavors may be added to 
            the main cheese layer. Additional flavors and visual 
            appeal may be added by topping the finished dessert 
            with fruit, whipped cream, nuts, cookies, fruit sauce, 
            chocolate syrup, or other ingredients.</p>

        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>6 pecan shortbread cookies, finely crushed</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>6 canning jars with lid</li>
            <li>12 ounces sliced fresh strawberries</li>
            <li>1 package cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
            <li> 1/2 cup heavy cream, whipped</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir together cookie crumbs, butter, and 2 
                tablespoons sugar in a bowl until blended. Divide 
                mixture evenly among jars (about 3 1/2 tablespoons 
                each) and gently press (do not pack) into 
                bottoms.</li>
            <li>Halve 6 strawberries for garnish, and set aside. 
                Chop remaining strawberries.</li>
            <li>Beat together cream cheese, lemon juice, and 1/2 
                cup sugar in bowl with an electric mixer at medium 
                speed until smooth. Fold in whipped cream and 
                chopped berries, and divide evenly among jars 
                (about 1/2 cup each). Top each with a 2 berry 
                halves and cover with lids. Chill at least 2 
                hours and up to 3 days.</li>
