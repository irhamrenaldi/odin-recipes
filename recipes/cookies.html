        <h4>These cookies are the pinnacle of perfection! If you want a big, fat,
            chewy cookie like the kind you see at bakeries and specialty shops, then 
            these are the cookies for you!</h4>

        <p>A chocolate chip cookie is a drop cookie that features chocolate chips or 
            chocolate morsels as its distinguishing ingredient. Chocolate chip cookies 
            originated in the United States around 1938, when Ruth Graves Wakefield 
            chopped up a Nestlé semi-sweet chocolate bar and added the chopped 
            chocolate to a cookie recipe.</p>
        <p>Generally, the recipe starts with a dough composed of flour, butter, both 
            brown and white sugar, semi-sweet chocolate chips, eggs, and vanilla. 
            Variations on the recipe may add other types of chocolate, as well as 
            additional ingredients such as nuts or oatmeal. There are also vegan 
            versions with the necessary ingredient substitutions, such as vegan 
            chocolate chips, vegan margarine, and egg substitutes. A chocolate 
            chocolate chip cookie uses a dough flavored with chocolate or cocoa 
            powder, before chocolate chips are mixed in. These variations of the 
            recipe are also referred to as ‘double’ or ‘triple’ chocolate chip 
            cookies, depending on the combination of dough and chocolate types.</p>
        
        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3/4 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 egg yolk</li>
            <li>2 cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). 
                Grease cookie sheets or line with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Sift together the flour, baking soda and salt; set aside.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, cream together the melted butter, brown sugar and 
                white sugar until well blended. Beat in the vanilla, egg, and egg yolk 
                until light and creamy. Mix in the sifted ingredients until just blended. 
                Stir in the chocolate chips by hand using a wooden spoon. Drop cookie 
                dough 1/4 cup at a time onto the prepared cookie sheets. Cookies should be 
                about 3 inches apart.</li>
            <li>Bake for 15 to 17 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the edges 
                are lightly toasted. Cool on baking sheets for a few minutes before 
                transferring to wire racks to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
