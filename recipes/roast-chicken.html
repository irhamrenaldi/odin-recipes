        <h5>The easiest and best roast chicken recipe! I use 
            organic chickens.</h5>

        <p>The best roast chicken has garlic herb butter under and 
            on the skin, is stuffed with lemon and herbs, roasted 
            until it’s crispy and deep golden on the outside, and 
            juicy on the inside.</p>
        <p>It’s really easy to prepare a whole chicken for 
            roasting. The trick is to use an upside down dessert 
            spoon to loosen the skin – the shape hugs the curves of the 
            chicken and it doesn’t tear the skin.</p>

        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
            <li>2 lemons, cut in half</li>
            <li>6 large cloves garlic</li>
            <li>1 (4 pound) whole chicken</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoon cold butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>Salt dan pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 
                Pour the wine into a 10-inch cast-iron skillet; set 
                aside.</li>
            <li>Place the lemon halves and garlic cloves into the 
                cavity of the chicken. Slide half of the butter 
                underneath the skin of each breast. Rub the chicken 
                all over with Dijon mustard, then season to taste with 
                salt and pepper. Place into the cast-iron skillet.</li>
            <li>Bake the chicken in the preheated oven for 15 
                minutes, then reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 
                degrees C), and continue baking until no longer 
                pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 1 
                hour more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into 
                the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should 
                read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C). Remove the chicken 
                from the oven, cover with a doubled sheet of aluminum 
                foil, and allow to rest in a warm area for 15 minutes 
                before slicing.</li>
        </ol>
